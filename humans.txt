  Standards: HTML5, CSS3
  Components: YouMightNotNeedjQuery
  Software:
    I design in Illustrator. I convert designs with Brackets. Bourbon and SCSS make
    CSS just about bearable. Bower for all those good frontend dependencies.
    And I develop in Chrome. Cross browser testing in IE gives me the chills.
    JPEGmini is my favorite loss-less image compression program for JPEGs, and
    ImageOptim is great for PNGs too.

    Unix stuff:
      My favorite text editor is vim, although Sublime Text gets an honorable mention.
      I can't use iTerm without tmux. And of course where would I be without git?
      My preferred language is Ruby because it makes me happy.

    Mac gems:
      I can't use Finder without TotalFinder.
      Dash is great for quick code referencing, though I spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow.
      Quicksilver is maybe the coolest thing.
      Windownaut is a must have (or the free Spectacle) for actual window management.
      Karabiner lets me do some vim-y keybindings.
      Dropbox.
      And TextExpander so I never have to type my name again. Mmm... keystroke saving.
      I typically jam out to Alternative Rock on Spotify.

    Misc:
      I've been playing guitar since 6th grade. Recently, I've started learning piano.
      I try to maintain a beginner's mindset. If I'm not good at something, I know 
      I can work at it to get better.
