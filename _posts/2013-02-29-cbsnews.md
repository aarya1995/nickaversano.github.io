Over the summer after my freshman year, I worked in New York for CBSNews.com's frontend team. I implemented the new designs for 60 Minutes, 48 Hours, sitemap and more as a part of the company's highlander project. Day to day tasks included frontend development and fixing bugs on the company's intranet.
